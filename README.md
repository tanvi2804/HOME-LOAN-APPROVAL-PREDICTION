## Introduction 🏡

Owning a home is a dream for many people, but for most, it is not possible without taking out a home loan. Home loans are a crucial part of the banking industry, and the process of loan approval is a crucial step in this industry. The loan approval process involves assessing the creditworthiness of the applicant and evaluating various financial factors to determine the risk involved in lending money to the applicant.

## Methodology 🛠️

The methodology includes data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model development, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance. Machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are employed to develop a predictive model.

## Data Set 📊

The dataset used in this project includes 614 observations and 13 variables, containing both qualitative and quantitative variables relevant for predicting home loan approvals.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 📈

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain an understanding of the data, identify patterns and relationships, and detect anomalies or outliers. Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heat maps are used for visualization.

## Machine Learning Algorithms 🤖

Three machine learning algorithms are used in this project:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting loan approval status.

## Results 📝

The accuracy of the models is as follows:

- Logistic Regression: 84.72%
- Decision Tree: 85.4%
- Random Forest: 82.16%

The Decision Tree model showed the highest accuracy among the three models.

## Conclusion and Future Scope 🔮

The project concludes that the Decision Tree model is the most accurate in predicting home loan approvals. Future research can explore more advanced ensemble learning techniques and investigate the impact of different feature selection techniques on model performance.
